# admin-dashboard

Admin dashboard project for intermediate HTML and CSS course. The goal of this
project was to become comfortable using CSS grid to style and layout web pages.
For this project I mainly used CSS grid for the layout, but also played around
with other things learned throughout this course such as CSS variables, SVGs,
pseudoclasses and selectors, and other minor design elements such as box shadows,
gradients, and a few transitions.
